**_Description of Project:_**

For our project, we want to create something similar to an IRC(Internet Relay Chat) which is essentially a system for chatting.  Upon starting the program, the user will be prompted to either create an account or log back in.  Afterward, they will be automatically be put into the main room in which their messages will be received and seen by everyone else in the main room.  From there, the user will also be create/enter chat rooms where they can chat with someone one on one.  Like an IRC, the text itself will be very simple due to limitations of the terminal(No pictures, voice callsâ€¦.etc).  In addition to the main room, we plan on adding additional servers for users to chat on overall as a group.
